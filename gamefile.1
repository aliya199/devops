# Subway-Surfers-like Endless Runner (Java, Swing)

A simple 2D endless-runner prototype written in plain Java and Swing. This project is a minimal, self-contained starting point for building a Subway Surfers–style game.

Features
- 3 lanes (left, center, right)
- Switch lanes (Left/Right arrows)
- Jump (Up arrow or Space)
- Obstacles and coins spawn and move toward the player
- Score, high speed progression, basic collision detection
- No external libraries required — runs on any standard JDK

How to run
1. Make sure you have JDK 11+ installed.
2. Compile:
   - From project root:
     javac -d out src/main/java/com/aliya199/subwaysim/*.java
3. Run:
   - java -cp out com.aliya199.subwaysim.Main

Or import the `src` folder into your IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) and run `Main`.

What I did
- Added a runnable Swing-based game core (game loop + rendering).
- Implemented player controls, spawning, and basic collision handling.
- Provided a simple, extensible code structure so you can add graphics, sounds, and tile/level systems.

What's next
- Replace placeholders with sprite art and animations.
- Add particle effects, sound effects, and music.
- Improve physics (smooth acceleration, gravity tuning), and add power-ups.
- Add menus, pause/resume, and a persistent high-score file.
